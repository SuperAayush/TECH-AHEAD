# About Project:

Welcome, Everyone.
Since you have come to our website you must be confused about dozens of Technologies Lies Ahead which one is best for you, which one is perfectly aligned towards your career, and much many more questions arising in your minds. Here on “TECH AHEAD” we provide you with information regarding trendy technologies. We have mainly three sections on our website i.e. Artificial Intelligence, BlockChain, and DevOps, where you can explore them. As you know without Projects any learning is not worth it. So, there is a project section available through which you can take ideas and make projects while learning. It is the most effective way to learn about any Technology. Nowadays passive Learning is the most common way to grasp anything so for that we have a Blogs and Videos Section too. With these two you came to know about trendy technologies going on. One more best thing for you is, if you want to learn any technology in depth then there is a Learning Platform column which will render you to any Learning Platform and you can learn that technology in depth.
This is like “ALL IN ONE BEST SOLUTION FOR TECHIE” where you will get all the resources in one place.
We would always love your contribution to o
ur website and we also have a contribute section with our Github repository so that you can help us in Contributing more by adding some features, knowledge, content, or your experience which will help the community.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
